# Known versions of R - just create additional entries as needed
# Your chances of a successful build go down with older versions
# or with a version different from what the Makefile reports as
# the default.

# To update this file, copy the bottom-most two rows for CRAN
# and Bioconductor (so the latest CRAN is always cloud.r-project.org,
# and Bioconductor is whatever version they say goes with that.
# Update the previous version to cran.microsoft.com, with the
# snapshot date set to the date listed as the release of the new
# version (see cran.r-project.org for the release date and new
# version).

# Slight change in strategy: CRAN itself keeps an up-to-date
# repository for each major R version (4.0, 4.1, 4.2). So we
# can keep pointing at cloud.r-project.org in perpetuity for
# the ultimate minor R version of each major R version. We only
# have to dip into the microsoft snapshots for the previous
# minor versions. Updated here for that strategy, 2022-10-31
