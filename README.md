# VisionEval Repositories

There are four repositories in the VisionEval organization to serve different purposes:

 - **[VisionEval](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval)**: Public release version of VisionEval. There is one master branch only. This wiki is associated with the VisionEval repository. If you have a bug report or other issue, create an issue instead in the VisionEval-Dev repository ([here](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Dev/issues)).
 
 - **[VisionEval-Dev](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Dev)**: Main repository for developers and power-users who want to contribute code improvements. There are multiple branches, including `master` (which is can be considered the beta release) and `development` where active code development happens. Additional branches can be used to evaluate new features or pull requests. Developers / power-users should [create issues](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Dev/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Dev/pulls) to this repository.
 
 - **[VisionEval.org](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval.org)**: Website repository. You can [create issues](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval.org/issues) here for website-related change requests.
