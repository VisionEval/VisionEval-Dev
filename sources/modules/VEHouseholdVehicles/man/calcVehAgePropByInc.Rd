\description{
\code{calcVehAgePropByInc} Calculates vehicle age distributions by
household income group.
}
\details{
This function calculates vehicle age distributions by household income group.
It takes marginal distributions of vehicles by age and households by income
group along with a data frame of the joint probability distribution of
vehicles by age and income group, and then uses iterative proportional
fitting to adjust the joint probabilities to match the margins. The
probabilities by income group are calculated from the fitted joint
probability matrix. The age margin is the proportional distribution of
vehicles by age calculated by adjusting the cumulative age distribution
for autos or light trucks to match a target mean age. The income
margin is the proportional distribution of vehicles by household income group
($0-20K, $20K-40K, $40K-60K, $60K-80K, $80K-100K, $100K or more) calculated
from the modeled household values.
