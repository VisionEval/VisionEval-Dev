\description{
\code{AssignDriverlessVehicles} assigns driverless vehicle to each household.
}
\details{
This function randomly assigns household vehicles as driverless based on the driverless
probability given by age and vehicle type. The household vehicels owned are assigned 
a value of 1 if driverless and 0 otherwise based on age and vehicle type. The household vehicles 
with vehicle access of service type are assigned a driverless probability based on vehicle age 
and type. The function also calcualates a preliminary estimate of proportion of household DVMT 
that is in driverless vehicles. This estimate is obtained by dividing the sum of vehicles that are 
driverless by sum of vehicles that are other than low level car service vehicle access type by
each household.
