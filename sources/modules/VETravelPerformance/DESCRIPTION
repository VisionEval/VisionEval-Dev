Description: Contains modules for calculating fuel consumption, emissions, 
    roadway speeds and delay, and vehicle use costs. Working together, these
    modules also balance household travel costs and the amount of household
    DVMT. Household DVMT is split among household vehicles and between
    household vehicles and car services based on composite costs (out-of-pocket
    and travel time). Calculates fuel consumption (including electricity) and
    greenhouse gas emissions for households, light-duty commercial service
    vehicles, heavy trucks, and public transit modes.
