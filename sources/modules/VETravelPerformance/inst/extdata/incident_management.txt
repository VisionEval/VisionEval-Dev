Documentation for incident_management.csv
=========================================
Data in this file is used in the CalculateRoadPerformance.R script to specify the percentage reduction in recurring and non-recurring delay on freeways and on arterials that would occur at each congestion level with full implementation of incident management on freeways. Full implementation of incident management includes real-time monitoring of freeways within an urbanized area with a traffic operations center or other system to identify traffic incidents (e.g. vehicle collisions, disabled vehicles, objects on roadway) and to dispatch responders to clear the incidents, and a fleet of trained and equipped public/private responders who can render aid and clear the incidents in a timely manner. Congestion categories are those defined by the Texas Transportation Institute for the Urban Mobility Study and include the following: None = none, Mod = moderate, Hvy = heavy, Sev = severe, Ext = extreme. Recurring congestion is congestion that occurs in the absence of traffic accidents and other incidents (e.g. disabled vehicle on shoulder, object on roadway). Non-recurring congestion is congestion that occurs because of traffic accidents or other incidents. Delay is the difference in the travel rate (hours per mile) between the average speed at the congestion level and the average speed with no congestion.
