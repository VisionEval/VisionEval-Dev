Documentation for signal_coordination.csv
=========================================
Data in this file is used in the CalculateRoadPerformance.R script to specify the percentage reduction in recurring and non-recurring delay on freeways and on arterials that would occur at each congestion level with full implementation of signal coordination on arterials. Signal coordination is the practice of timing when signals are green for traffic flowing in each direction on the arterial so that vehicles traveling at or near the speed limit will be able to travel a number of signalized intersections without having to stop. This is also called signal progression. Full implementation includes coordinated signals on all arterials where travel delay on the arterial could be reduced with signal coordination. Congestion categories are those defined by the Texas Transportation Institute for the Urban Mobility Study and include the following: None = none, Mod = moderate, Hvy = heavy, Sev = severe, Ext = extreme. Recurring congestion is congestion that occurs in the absence of traffic accidents and other incidents (e.g. disabled vehicle on shoulder, object on roadway). Non-recurring congestion is congestion that occurs because of traffic accidents or other incidents. Delay is the difference in the travel rate (hours per mile) between the average speed at the congestion level and the average speed with no congestion.
