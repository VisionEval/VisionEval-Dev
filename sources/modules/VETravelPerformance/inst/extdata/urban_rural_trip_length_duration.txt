Documentation for urban_rural_trip_length_duration.csv
======================================================
Data in this file is used in the CalculateRoadPerformance.R script to calculate average travel speed in rural areas (i.e. not in an urbanized area) from travel speed in urban areas (i.e. in an urbanized area). Data on urban and rural average vehicle trip length and average vehicle trip duration by census region are used to calculate average vehicle trip speed for urban and rural areas by census region. The ratios of the rural to urban speeds calculates a scaling factor that is used to scale average travel speed on urban roads in an marea to get average travel speed on non-urban roads.
