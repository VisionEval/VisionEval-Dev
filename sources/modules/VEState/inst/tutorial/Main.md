# VE-STATE Tutorial
----

## VESTATE

VE-STATE is an extension of RSPM models, namely VERSPM, which enables users to apply the model for statewide applications. In order to develop VE-STATE, VE-RSPM modules has been tested and modified to confirm that they will work in a statewide application.
The main difference between VE-RSPM models and VE-STATE models is that a number of VE-RSPM inputs are specified at the Bzone level. Examples include numbers of dwelling units by type and numbers of jobs by sector. VE-STATE models run at a higher level of abstraction than VE-RSPM models and donâ€™t have Bzone level inputs.
