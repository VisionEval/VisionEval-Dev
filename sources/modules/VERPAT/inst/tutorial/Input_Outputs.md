All VERPAT inputs and outputs are described in the following pages:

  - [Inputs and Parameters](VERPAT-Inputs-and-Parameters) - VERPAT data inputs are classified into two categories: *Inputs* and *Model Parameters*. This page provides a thorough guidance to the end user of VERPAT (previously RPAT) on how to build scenarios. It describes in detail the difference between the two input categories and how to use them in running a VERPAT model.
  - [Modules and Outputs by Module](VERPAT-Modules-and-Outputs) - VERPAT model is built using several modules and this page describes the inputs and outputs at the modular level. It gives detailed information about the association between the modules and is catered towards developers to aid them in modifying/updating any modules.
  - [Converting RPAT inputs to VERPAT](RPAT-to-VERPAT) - This page describes the connection between RPAT input and parameter files to VERPAT inputs.
