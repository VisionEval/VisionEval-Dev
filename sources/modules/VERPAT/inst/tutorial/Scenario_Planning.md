This section introduces scenario planning. What is it?  Why is it done?

### A definition of scenario planning

Scenario planning is a process to develop and analyze the future based on different assumptions about future uncertainties. A defining characteristic of successful public sector scenario planning is that it actively involves the public, the business community, and elected officials on a broad scale, educating them about growth trends and trade-offs, and incorporating their values and feedback into future plans. VERPAT is one of several analytical tools and models developed to support scenario planning.


### Scenario planning framework

Scenario planning provides a framework for developing a shared vision for the future by analyzing the various forces that affect growth

  + Health
  + Transportation
  + Economics
  + Environmental
  + Land use
  
### Benefits of scenario planning

  + Helps agencies align informed and strategic transportation decision-making with regional goals
  + Integrates regional transportation and local land use stakeholders to collectively better understand and visualize future transportation and land use patterns
  + Improves public and stakeholder involvement through coordinated outreach
  + Scenario planning software helps develop and assess scenarios and visualize the differences between alternatives
  + Broadens agency and public understanding by exploring future challenges and opportunities
### Scenario planning at FHWA/FTA

FHWA provides scenario planning technical assistance and guidebooks [here](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/scenario_and_visualization/scenario_planning/).  FHWA also offers  workshops, webinars, innovative uses and other resources to assist transportation agencies to support scenario planning for local, regional or statewide activities.

### Practitioner needs 

Most agencies are interested in scenario planning as a strategy to evaluate new policies for land use, pricing, new vehicle and information technologies and travel demand management. These are policies that are more difficult for most travel demand forecasting models. 

Many agencies need coordination, cooperation, and communication with local governments on land use policy, since land use regulations are governed by local governments. 

Agencies also want to understand 

  + Induced demand
  + Travel demand management
  + Urban form
  + Congestion reduction
  + Outcomes and performance
  
### Gaps in research

Background research in five areas provided the framework for VERPAT to address gaps in the research, where travel impacts are not directly observable.

### Land use scenarios

Land use scenarios are based on place types, determined by the type of area and the type of development.

### Transportation scenarios

Transportation scenarios are based on changes in travel demand, transportation supply or transportation policies. 

Travel Demand

  + Trip-making, defined as auto trips per capita and the transit trips per capita
  + Population, defined as persons by age for the base and future years
  + Employment, defined as employees by firm size and industry and employment growth 
  + Household income, defined as regional average per capita income by forecast year in year 2000 dollars
  + Auto and light truck proportions of VMT by year
  + Truck and bus VMT by year
  + Induced demand â€“ short term impacts

Transportation Supply

  + Amount of regional transit service, defined as bus and rail revenue miles
  + Amount of roadway capacity, defined as freeway and arterial capacity

Transportation Policies

  + Pricing, including vehicle use charges, such as VMT charges or gas taxes, and parking pricing.Vehicle use charges are considered as a factor of auto operating charges and parking pricing are considered as an additional cost at employment or other locations.
  + Travel demand management (TDM), including vanpool, telecommuting, ridesharing, and transit pass programs.
  + Intelligent transportation system (ITS), which estimates speeds with and without incidents. This computes an overall
average speed by road type and congestion level.
Each policy is implemented as an adjustment to VMT based on the policy inputs. 
 
### Strategic models for integrated land use and transportation

VERPAT is an example of a strategic model developed to test policies, infrastructure investments and changes in demographics. These models support strategic planning efforts by allowing users to consider hundreds of possible scenarios easily. VERPAT combines higher level analysis of the transportation supply with individual characteristics of travel demand, built environment and policies such as:
  + Growth by place type
  + Households (persons by age and income)
  + Firms (employees and industry)
  + Income growth
  + Truck and bus VMT
  + Accessibility
  + Congestion
  + Induced growth
  + Policy benefits
 
Strategic models bridge the gap between regional visioning and specific plans <img align="right" width="100" border=1 src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/strategic_model_purpose.png">

### The Rapid Policy Assessment Tool process

VERPAT is a disaggregate policy model that predicts travel demand impacts at an individual household level.
