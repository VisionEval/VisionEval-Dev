## AssignParkingRestrictions Module
#### February 7, 2018
#
#This module identifies parking restrictions and prices affecting households at their residences, workplaces, and other places they are likely to visit in the urban area. The module takes user inputs on parking restrictions and prices by Bzone and calculates for each household the number of free parking spaces available at the household's residence, which workers pay for parking and whether their payment is part of a *cash-out-buy-back* program, the cost of residential parking for household vehicles that can't be parked in a free space, the cost for workplace parking, and the cost of parking for other activities such as shopping. The parking restriction/cost information is used by other modules in calculating the cost of vehicle ownership and the cost of vehicle use.
#
### Model Parameter Estimation
#
#This module has no estimated parameters.
#
### How the Module Works
#
#The user provides inputs by Marea and 3 of 4 area types the following information which provide the basis for calculating
#parking restrictions and costs for each household. These include:
#
#- Average number of free parking spaces per single-family dwelling unit
#
#- Average number of free parking spaces per multifamily dwelling unit
#
#- Average number of free parking spaces per group quarters resident
#
#- Proportion of workers working at jobs in the Bzone who pay for parking
#
#- Proportion of worker paid parking in *cash-out_buy-back* program
#
#- Average daily parking cost
#
#The user only provides information for the *center*, *inner*, and *outer* area types. For simplicity it is assumed that there are no parking restrictions or costs in fringe areas.
#
#Free residential parking spaces are applied to each household based on the user inputs for available spaces for the dwelling type of the household and area type of the Bzone where the household resides. If the average number of parking spaces is not an integer, the household is assigned the integer amount of spaces and a possible additional space determined through a random draw with the decimal portion serving as the probability of success. For example, if the average is 1.75 spaces, all households would be assigned at least 1 space and 75% of the households would be assigned 2 spaces. The daily parking cost assigned to the area type of the Bzone where the household resides is assigned to the household to use in vehicle ownership cost calculations.
#
#A worker is assigned as paying or not paying for parking through a random draw with the probability of paying equal to the proportion of paying workers that is input for the area type of the worker's job location. A worker identified as paying for parking is identified as being in a *cash-out-buy-back* program through a random draw with the participation probability being the input value for the area type of the worker's job location. The daily parking cost assigned to the worker's job site area type is assigned to the work to use in vehicle use calculations.
#
#Average daily parking costs for other (non-work) household travel purposes (e.g. shopping) are assigned to households based on their location type and area type. Households in rural and town locations are assigned a value of 0. Households in urban locations are assigned a weighted average value of the parking costs assigned to the area types in the urban area where the proportion of urban retail and service employment in each area type is used as the weighting factor. This cost is adjusted to account for the number of household vehicle trips when the household's vehicle use costs are calculated.

#' Main module function to assign parking restrictions to each household.
#'
#' \code{AssignParkingRestrictions} assigns parking restrictions to each

#' restrictions.
#'
#' This function assigns parking restrictions to households. This includes
#' restrictions on parking household vehicles and restrictions on parking
#' vehicles at the household workers places of work. The function identifies the
#' number of free parking spaces the household may use, the charge for household
#' parking per vehicle if they exceed the number of free spaces, how many
#' household workers pay for parking, the charge they have to pay, and the
#' amount of the work parking charges that are 'cash-out-buy-back'.
