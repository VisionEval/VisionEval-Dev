## AssignCarSvcAvailability Module
#### February 7, 2019
#
#This module assigns car service availability levels (Low, High) to Bzones and households. Car services include taxis, car sharing services (e.g. Car-To-Go, Zipcar), and future automated taxi services. A high car service level is one that has access times that are competitive with private car use, where access time is the time to get to the vehicle (or to wait for the vehicle to arrive) and the time to get from the vehicle to the destination (including the time to park the vehicle). High level of car service is considered to increase household car availability similar to owning a car. Where a high level of car service is available a household may use the car service rather than own a vehicle if the cost of using the car service is lower than the cost of owning a vehicle. Low level car service does not have competitive access time and is not considered as increasing household car availability or substituting for owning a vehicle.
#
### Model Parameter Estimation
#
#This module has no model parameters.
#
### How the Module Works
#
#The user specifies the proportion of activity (employment and households) served with a high level of car service by marea and area type. The module assigns high level car service to Bzones in each Marea and area type in the following steps:
#
#1. The proportion of total activity in each of the Bzones is calculated
#
#2. The Bzones are ordered in descending order of activity density assuming that higher density zones are more likely to have high service than lower density zones.
#
#3. The cumulative sum of activity proportion is calculated in the order determined in #2.
#
#4. The threshold where the cumulative sum is closest to the user defined proportion of activity served is identified.
#
#5. The Bzones in the order up to the threshold are identified.
