# SimulateUrbanMixMeasure Module
### February 6, 2019

This module simulates an urban mixed-use measure based on the 2001 National Household Travel Survey measure of the tract level urban/rural indicator. This measure developed by Claritas uses the density of the tract and surrounding tracts to identify the urban/rural context of the tract. The categories include urban, suburban, second city, town and rural. Mapping of example metropolitan areas shows that places shown as urban correspond to central city and inner neighborhoods that are typically characterized by mixed use, higher levels of urban accessibility, and higher levels of walk/bike/transit accessibility. Documentation for the measure is included in the 'inst/extdata/sources' directory of this package. Unfortunately this is the only land use measure (other than population density) included in the NHTS. It is used in several models where it is a significant predictor. It should be noted that this measure has no established relationship to the other 4D measures that are simulated by modules in this package.

## Model Parameter Estimation

This model uses the binary logit model estimated in the CalculateUrbanMixMeasure module of the VELandUse package. The model calculates the probability that a household is located in an urban mixed-use neighborhood as a function of the population density of the Bzone that household resides in and the housing type of the household. The model is estimated using NHTS household level data. A summary of the model is as follows:

```

Where:

* LocalPopDensity is the density of the census block group where the household is located in persons per square mile; and

* IsSF is a dummy variable with a value of 1 if the household lives in a single family dwelling and 0 otherwise.

Although the model is estimated at the household level, it is applied at the zonal level as described in the next section.

## How the Module Works

The model iterates through model Mareas and assigns the SimBzones in each Marea as being urban-mixed character or not. The result is a vector of 1s and 0s where a value of 1 means that the SimBzone is of urban-mixed character. Users input urban-mix target values for each Marea. Values can be either NA or a number between 0 and 1. If a number is provided, the module will select a number of zones such that the proportion of Marea households in those zones is closest to the the target. If the value is NA, the module will calculate the most likely proportion of households that will be in urban-mixed neighborhoods (SimBzones). Following are the steps in the procedure:

1. The inputs for the procedure are as follows:

   * Matrix of the number of households by SimBzone and dwelling unit type: *Hh_BzHt*

   * Vector of the population density (persons per square mile) by SimBzone: *Den_Bz*

   * Target for the proportion of households in urban-mixed SimBzones: *Target*

2. The total number of households in each SimBzone is calculated: *Hh_Bz*

3. A matrix of probabilities by SimBzone and housing type is calculated by applying the binomial choice model for each combination of SimBone (population density) and housing type: *Prob_BzHt*.

4. A weighted average probability is calculated for each SimBzone using the matrix of households (*Hh_BzHt*) and the matrix of probabilities (*Prob_BzHt*): *Prob_Bz*.

5. If the *Target* value for the Marea is NA, the target is calculated by calculated the expected proportion of households in urban-mixed neighborhoods as follows: *sum(Prob_Bz * Hh_Bz) / sum(Hh_Bz)*

6. SimBzones are identified as urban-mixed by evaluating in descending order of probability, calculating the cumulative proportion of Marea households, and determining which cumulative proportion is closest to the *Target*.


## User Inputs
The following table(s) document each input file that must be provided in order for the module to run correctly. User input files are comma-separated valued (csv) formatted text files. Each row in the table(s) describes a field (column) in the input file. The table names and their meanings are as follows:

NAME - The field (column) name in the input file. Note that if the 'TYPE' is 'currency' the field name must be followed by a period and the year that the currency is denominated in. For example if the NAME is 'HHIncomePC' (household per capita income) and the input values are in 2010 dollars, the field name in the file must be 'HHIncomePC.2010'. The framework uses the embedded date information to convert the currency into base year currency amounts. The user may also embed a magnitude indicator if inputs are in thousand, millions, etc. The VisionEval model system design and users guide should be consulted on how to do that.

TYPE - The data type. The framework uses the type to check units and inputs. The user can generally ignore this, but it is important to know whether the 'TYPE' is 'currency'

UNITS - The units that input values need to represent. Some data types have defined units that are represented as abbreviations or combinations of abbreviations. For example 'MI/HR' means miles per hour. Many of these abbreviations are self evident, but the VisionEval model system design and users guide should be consulted.

PROHIBIT - Values that are prohibited. Values may not meet any of the listed conditions.

ISELEMENTOF - Categorical values that are permitted. Value must be one of the listed values.

UNLIKELY - Values that are unlikely. Values that meet any of the listed conditions are permitted but a warning message will be given when the input data are processed.

## Datasets Used by the Module
The following table documents each dataset that is retrieved from the datastore and used by the module. Each row in the table describes a dataset. All the datasets must be present in the datastore. One or more of these datasets may be entered into the datastore from the user input files. The table names and their meanings are as follows:

NAME - The dataset name.

TABLE - The table in the datastore that the data is retrieved from.

GROUP - The group in the datastore where the table is located. Note that the datastore has a group named 'Global' and groups for every model run year. For example, if the model run years are 2010 and 2050, then the datastore will have a group named '2010' and a group named '2050'. If the value for 'GROUP' is 'Year', then the dataset will exist in each model run year group. If the value for 'GROUP' is 'BaseYear' then the dataset will only exist in the base year group (e.g. '2010'). If the value for 'GROUP' is 'Global' then the dataset will only exist in the 'Global' group.

TYPE - The data type. The framework uses the type to check units and inputs. Refer to the model system design and users guide for information on allowed types.

UNITS - The units that input values need to represent. Some data types have defined units that are represented as abbreviations or combinations of abbreviations. For example 'MI/HR' means miles per hour. Many of these abbreviations are self evident, but the VisionEval model system design and users guide should be consulted.

PROHIBIT - Values that are prohibited. Values in the datastore do not meet any of the listed conditions.

ISELEMENTOF - Categorical values that are permitted. Values in the datastore are one or more of the listed values.
