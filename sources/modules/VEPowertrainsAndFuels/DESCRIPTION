Description: Contains modules for inputting default powertrain and fuel
    characteristics and for allowing households to override some of the defaults
    with characteristics for their region. Calculates the carbon intensity of 
    fuels and assigns powertrains and powertrain characteristics to household 
    vehicles and car service vehicles. The default values are for the Oregon
    DOT Adopted Plans scenario as of February 25, 2020. The ICEV MPG values
    by model year were adjusted 6% lower to better match validation targets for
    fuel consumption. This is the "xAP" version, 2020-07-24.
