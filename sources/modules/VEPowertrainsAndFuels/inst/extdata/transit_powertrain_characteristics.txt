This file contains values for key powertrain characteristics for the public transit fleet vehicles that are used in calculating amounts of fuel and electric power consumed.

File Structure
--------------
Each row is a decade year from 1990 to 2050. The range of years needs to be sufficient to encompass all model run years that are anticipated.
Column names as follows:
Year: The year to which the data apply
VanIcevMpg: The average fuel economy (miles per gasoline gallon equivalent) of vans with internal combustion engine powertrains
VanHevMpg: The average fuel economy (miles per gasoline gallon equivalent) of vans with hybrid electric powertrains
VanBevMpkwh: The average efficiency (miles per kilowatt-hour) of vans with battery electric powertrains
BusIcevMpg: The average fuel economy (miles per gasoline gallon equivalent) of buses with internal combustion engine powertrains
BusHevMpg: The average fuel economy (miles per gasoline gallon equivalent) of buses with hybrid electric powertrains
BusBevMpkwh: The average efficiency (miles per kilowatt-hour) of buses with battery electric powertrains
RailIcevMpg: The average fuel economy (miles per gasoline gallon equivalent) of rail vehicles with internal combustion engine powertrains
RailHevMpg: The average fuel economy (miles per gasoline gallon equivalent) of rail vehicles with hybrid electric powertrains
RailBevMpkwh: The average efficiency (miles per kilowatt-hour) of rail vehicles with electric powertrains
