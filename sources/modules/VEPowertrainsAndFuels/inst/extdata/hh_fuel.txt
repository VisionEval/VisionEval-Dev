Documentation for hh_fuel.csv
=============================

This file contains values for the proportions of hydrocarbon fuels used to power household vehicles by fuel type (gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas) and vehicle type (auto, light truck). Note that these include fuel blends (e.g. gasoline blended with ethanol). Blending proportions are specified in the "ldv_biofuel_mix.csv" file. The data in these files as well as in the "carbon_intensity.csv" file are used to calculate the average carbon intensity of hydrocarbon fuels used by household vehicles. Note that the proportions in this file do not represent volumetric proportions (e.g. gallons), they represent energy proportions (e.g. gasoline gallon equivalents) or DVMT proportions.

File Structure
--------------
Each row is a decade year from 1990 to 2050. The range of years needs to be sufficient to encompass all model run years that are anticipated.
Column names as follows:
Year: The year to which the data apply
AutoPropGasoline: The gasoline proportion of hydrocarbon fuels used by automobiles
AutoPropDiesel: The diesel proportion of hydrocarbon fuels used by automobiles
AutoPropCng: The compressed natural gas proportion of hydrocarbon fuels used by automobiles
LtTrkPropGasoline: The gasoline proportion of hydrocarbon fuels used by light trucks
LtTrkPropDiesel: The diesel proportion of hydrocarbon fuels used by light trucks
LtTrkPropCng: The compressed natural gas proportion of hydrocarbon fuels used by light trucks
