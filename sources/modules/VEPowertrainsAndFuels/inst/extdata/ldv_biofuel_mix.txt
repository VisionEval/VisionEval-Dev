Each row is a decade year from 1990 to 2050. The range of years needs to be sufficient to encompass all model run years that are anticipated.
Column names as follows:
Year: The year to which the data apply
EthanolPropGasoline: The ethanol proportion of gasoline blend fuels used by automobiles and light trucks
BiodieselPropDiesel: The biodiesel proportion of diesel blend fuels used by automobiles and light trucks
RngPropCng: The renewable natural gas proportion of compressed natural gas blend fuels used by automobiles and light trucks
