========================================

This file contains values for the biofuel proportions of hydrocarbon fuels used by heavy trucks. For example if the gasoline used by heavy trucks is 5% ethanol, the ethanol proportion of gasoline (EthanolPropGasoline) would be 0.05.

File Structure
--------------
Each row is a decade year from 1990 to 2050. The range of years needs to be sufficient to encompass all model run years that are anticipated.
Column names as follows:
Year: The year to which the data apply
EthanolPropGasoline: The ethanol proportion of gasoline blend fuels used by heavy trucks
BiodieselPropDiesel: The biodiesel proportion of diesel blend fuels used by heavy trucks
RngPropCng: The renewable natural gas proportion of liquified natural gas blend fuels used by heavy trucks
