Description: This package contains several modules which establish land use 
    characteristics of Bzones including employment by type, density, diversity,
    network design, and accessibility. Modules also identify the housing type
    and Bzone location of each household, create a Worker table and assign each
    worker to a Bzone job location, and identify whether each household is 
    located in an urbanized area or rural area. In addition, modules are
    included for processing several policy inputs related to land use that are
    applied at the Bzone level. These include parking, travel demand management
    programs, and car services.
