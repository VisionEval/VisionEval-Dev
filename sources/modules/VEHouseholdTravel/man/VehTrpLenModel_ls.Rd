\title{Household vehicle trip length models}
\format{
A list having the following 5 components:
Pow: estimated power for minimizing skew of trip length distribution;
DayModel: Summary estimation statistics for linear models of household trip
lengths on the survey day;
Metro: Linear model of average trip length based on simulated averages for
metropolitan households;
NonMetro: Linear model of average trip length based on simulated averaged for
non-metropolitan households;
TestResults_df: Data frame showing summary statistics for average DVMT, trip
length, daily vehicle trips, and daily vehicle trips per driver;
contains a string representing a hurdle model for computing household trips.
