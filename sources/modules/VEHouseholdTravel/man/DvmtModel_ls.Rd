\title{Daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) models}
\format{
A list having 'Metro' and 'NonMetro' components. Each component has
the following components:
Pow: factor to untransform the results of the average DVMT model;
Ave: the formula for the average DVMT model;
Pctl85: the formula for the 85th percentile DVMT model;
Pctl95: the formula for the 95th percentile DVMT model;
Pctl99: the formula for the 99th percentile DVMT model;
Pctl100: the formula for the 100th percentile DVMT model.
In addition, the 'EstimationStats' component of the list documents model
estimation statistics for the final models as well as intermediate models
used in developing the final models.

\description{
A list of components used to predict the average household DVMT and several
DVMT quantiles at 5% intervals as well as the 99th pecentile. The models are
linear regression models. The average DVMT model predicts average DVMT as a
power transform. The 'Pow' component contains the power term for
untransforming the model results. The percentile DVMT models predict the
household DVMT at variou percentiles as a function of the household's average
DVMT. This list also includes an 'EstimationStats' component which documents
model estimation statistics for these models as well as the intermediate
models that were used to create these final models.
