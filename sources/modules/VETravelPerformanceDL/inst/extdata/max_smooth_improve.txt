Documentation for max_smooth_improve.csv
========================================
Data in this file is used in the CalculateRoadPerformance.R script to calculate the effect on fuel consumption of operations programs such as active traffic management (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_traffic_management) which reduce speed variation on freeways (speed smoothing). 

File Structure
--------------
Rows contain data by speed level
Column names as follows:
