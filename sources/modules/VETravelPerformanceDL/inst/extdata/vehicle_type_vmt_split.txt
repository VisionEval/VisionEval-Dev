Documentation for vehicle_type_vmt_split...csv data files
=========================================================
This documentation addresses 6 related files identify the percentages of daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) by different vehicle types (motorcycles, passenger cars, light trucks, buses, single-unit trucks, combination trucks) for several roadway classes (interstate, other arterial, other) in urban and rural areas by state (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico). The files are as follows:
vehicle_type_vmt_split_rural_arterial.csv - percentages of DVMT by vehicle type on rural arterials by state
vehicle_type_vmt_split_rural_interstate.csv - percentages of DVMT by vehicle type on rural interstates by state
vehicle_type_vmt_split_rural_other.csv - percentages of DVMT by vehicle type on rural other roadways by state
vehicle_type_vmt_split_urban_arterial.csv - percentages of DVMT by vehicle type on urban arterials by state
vehicle_type_vmt_split_urban_interstate.csv - percentages of DVMT by vehicle type on urban interstates by state
vehicle_type_vmt_split_urban_other.csv - percentages of DVMT by vehicle type on rural urban roadways by state

Data in this file is used along with other datasets in the LoadDefaultRoadDvmtValues.R script to calculate default values for vehicle miles traveled by vehicle type (light-duty, heavy truck, bus) and urban and rural road class (freeway, arterial, other) for urban and rural areas by state and by urbanized area for the year 2010.
