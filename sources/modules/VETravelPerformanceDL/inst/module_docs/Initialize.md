# Initialize Module
### January 27, 2019

This module reads and processes roadway DVMT and operations inputs to check for inconsistent values which standard VisionEval data checks will not pick up.

## Model Parameter Estimation

This module has no estimated parameters.

## How the Module Works

This module checks the values in the following input files for missing values and inconsistencies that the standard VisionEval data checks will not identify:

* region_base_year_hvytrk_dvmt.csv

* marea_base_year_dvmt.csv

* marea_dvmt_split_by_road_class.csv

* marea_operations_deployment.csv

* other_ops_effectiveness.csv

* marea_congestion_charges.csv

The `region_base_year_hvytrk_dvmt.csv` and `marea_base_year_dvmt.csv` files are checked to assure that there is enough information to compute base year urban heavy truck DVMT and base year urban light-duty vehicle DVMT. These values are used in the calculation of vehicle travel on urban area roads which is are used in road performance calculations. The values in the 2 files are also checked for consistency. These inputs enable users to either declare explict values for regional heavy truck DVMT, marea urban heavy truck DVMT, and marea urban light-duty vehicle DVMT, or to specify locations (state and/or urbanized area) which are used for calculating DVMT from per capita rates tabulated for the areas from Highway Statistics data by the LoadDefaultRoadDvmtValues.R script. In addition, a check is made on if the model is likely to be a metropolitan model, not a state model, but a state is specified and state per capita heavy truck DVMT rates are used to calculate regional heavy truck DVMT. The value for StateAbbrLookup in the 'region_base_year_hvytrk_dvmt.csv' file should be NA in metropolitan models rather than a specific state if the regional heavy truck DVMT is not provided because the state rates may not be representative of the metropolitan rates. A warning is issued if this is the case.

If a value, rather than NA, is provided in the `StateAbbrLookup` field of the `region_base_year_hvytrk_dvmt.csv` file, the value must be a standard 2-character postal code for the state.

If a value other than NA is provided in the `UzaNameLookup` field of the `marea_base_year_dvmt.csv` file, it must be a name that is present in the following list of urbanized areas for which per capita rates are available for urban area light-duty vehicle DVMT and for urban area heavy-truck DVMT. Note that if the name of an urbanized area is not found in the list, the user can specify the name of any other urbanized area that is representative of the urbanized area being modeled.

The `marea_dvmt_split_by_road_class.csv` input file specifies the proportions of DVMT by road class for light-duty vehicles, for heavy trucks, and for buses. While this file is not optional, the user may leave entries blank. Where values are not provided, the model computes the splits using data tabulated for urbanized areas from Highway Statistics data by the LoadDefaultRoadDvmtValues.R script. The UzaNameLookup must be specified in the 'marea_base_year_dvmt.csv' for any marea for which complete data are not specified. The procedures check whether values are present for each marea or can be computed using name lookups. If values are provided, the procedures check that the sum of the splits for each vehicle type are equal to 1. If the sum is off by 1% or more, an error is flagged and a message to the log identifies the problem. If the sum is off by less than 1%, the splits are adjusted so that they sum to 1 and a warning message is written to the log. Input values are updated using values calculated from name lookups where necessary.

The `marea_operations_deployment.csv` and `other_ops_effectiveness.csv` are checked for consistency if the `other_ops_effectiveness.csv` file, which is optional, is present. If the `other_ops_effectiveness.csv` file is not present, then the values for the 'OtherFwyOpsDeployProp' and 'OtherArtOpsDeployProp' fields of the `marea_operations_deployment.csv` must be zero. If the `other_ops_effectiveness.csv` file is present but the values for delay reduction for freeways and/or arterials are 0, then the respective freeway and arterial values in the `marea_operations_deployment.csv` file must be 0 as well.

The `marea_congestion_charges.csv` is checked to determine whether congestion charges increase with congestion level (if they are not 0). If higher charges are found at lower levels than at higher levels, warnings are written to the log identifying the issue.


## User Inputs
The following table(s) document each input file that must be provided in order for the module to run correctly. User input files are comma-separated valued (csv) formatted text files. Each row in the table(s) describes a field (column) in the input file. The table names and their meanings are as follows:

NAME - The field (column) name in the input file. Note that if the 'TYPE' is 'currency' the field name must be followed by a period and the year that the currency is denominated in. For example if the NAME is 'HHIncomePC' (household per capita income) and the input values are in 2010 dollars, the field name in the file must be 'HHIncomePC.2010'. The framework uses the embedded date information to convert the currency into base year currency amounts. The user may also embed a magnitude indicator if inputs are in thousand, millions, etc. The VisionEval model system design and users guide should be consulted on how to do that.

TYPE - The data type. The framework uses the type to check units and inputs. The user can generally ignore this, but it is important to know whether the 'TYPE' is 'currency'

UNITS - The units that input values need to represent. Some data types have defined units that are represented as abbreviations or combinations of abbreviations. For example 'MI/HR' means miles per hour. Many of these abbreviations are self evident, but the VisionEval model system design and users guide should be consulted.

PROHIBIT - Values that are prohibited. Values may not meet any of the listed conditions.

ISELEMENTOF - Categorical values that are permitted. Value must be one of the listed values.

UNLIKELY - Values that are unlikely. Values that meet any of the listed conditions are permitted but a warning message will be given when the input data are processed.

DESCRIPTION - A description of the data.
