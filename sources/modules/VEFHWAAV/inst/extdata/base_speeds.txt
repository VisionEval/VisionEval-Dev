Documentation for base_speeds.csv
=================================
Data in this file is used in the CalculateRoadPerformance.R script to specify the base speeds for freeways and for arterials by congestion category. Base speeds are the average trip speeds when there are no freeway or arterial operations programs such as ramp metering, incident management, signal coordination, or access management in place. Congestion categories are those defined by the Texas Transportation Institute for the Urban Mobility Study and include the following: None = none, Mod = moderate, Hvy = heavy, Sev = severe, Ext = extreme. Data are provided for base speeds in consideration of both recurring and non-recurring congestion, and base speeds in consideration of only recurring congestion. Recurring congestion is congestion that occurs in the absence of traffic accidents and other incidents (e.g. disabled vehicle on shoulder, object on roadway). Non-recurring congestion is congestion that occurs because of traffic accidents or other incidents.

File Structure
--------------
Rows contain data by congestion category
Column names as follows:
Level: Congestion level: None, Mod, Hvy, Sev, Ext 
Fwy: Average freeway speed by congestion level considering the effects of both recurring and non-recurring congestion
Art: Average arterial speed by congestion level considering the effects of both recurring and non-recurring congestion
Fwy_Rcr: Average freeway speed by congestion level considering only the effects of recurring congestion
Art_Rcr: Average arterial speed by congestion level considering only the effects of recurring congestion
