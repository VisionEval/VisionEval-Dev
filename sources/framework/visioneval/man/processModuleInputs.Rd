\title{Process module input files}
\usage{
processModuleInputs(ModuleSpec_ls, ModuleName, Dir = "inputs")
}
\arguments{
\item{ModuleSpec_ls}{a list of module specifications that is consistent with
the VisionEval requirements.}

\item{ModuleName}{a string identifying the name of the module (used to document
module in error messages).}

\item{Dir}{a string identifying the relative path to the directory where the
model inputs are contained.}
}
\value{
A list containing the results of the input processing. The list has
two components. The first (Errors) is a vector of identified file and data
errors. The second (Data) is a list containing the data in the input files
organized in the standard format for data exchange with the datastore.
}
\description{
\code{processModuleInputs} a visioneval framework control function that
processes input files identified in a module's 'Inp' specifications in
preparation for saving in the datastore.
}
\details{
This function processes the input files identified in a module's 'Inp'
specifications in preparation for saving the data in the datastore. Several
processes are carried out. The existence of each specified input file is
checked. Any file whose corresponding 'GROUP' specification is 'Year', is
checked to determine that it has 'Year' and 'Geo' columns. The entries in the
'Year' and 'Geo' columns are checked to make sure they are complete and there
are no duplicates. Any file whose 'GROUP' specification is 'Global' or
'BaseYear' and whose 'TABLE' specification is a geographic specification
other than 'Region' is checked to determine if it has a 'Geo' column and the
entries are checked for completeness. Entries for years other than the
specified model run years are ignored. Data from input files is sorted by
years and geography as needed to assure that it is consistent even when user
input files are not consistent. The data in each column are checked against
specifications to determine conformance. The function returns a list which
contains a list of error messages and a list of the data inputs. The function
also writes error messages and warnings to the log file.
