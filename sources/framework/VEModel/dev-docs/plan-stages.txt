Configuration for stages [ DONE Pretty close to what was implemented ]

stageParam_ls (not strictly a configuration file):
  DONE: StageName identifies the Stage (unique within containing Model)
  StageDir identifies the output location for the Stage
    RunPath is built as ResultsDir/StageDir
  StagePath is used for only for *inputs*
    If set:
      If absolute and does not exist, unset StagePath with warning (try the rest anyway)
      If relative, set to ModelDir/StagePath
    If not set (or unset) or StagePath does not exist or is identical to ModelDir
      If StageDir is set, set to ModelDir/StageDir if that directory exists
      If StageDir is not set but ModelDir/StageName exists, StagePath set to ModelDir/StageName
    Arrive here with StagePath not set or set to absolute path of an existing directory
  If StageDir is not set at this point:
    if StagePath is set, StageDir is set to basename(StagePath)
    if StagePath is not set, StageDir is set to StageName
  Reportable:
    TRUE/FALSE if provided
    If not provided, TRUE if no other stage starts from this one
  StageConfig
    If StageConfig is not set:
      If StagePath is set, set to StagePath/visioneval.cnf if that file exists
    If StageConfig is set:
      If relative
        If StagePath is set, set to StagePath/StageConfig
        Else set to ModelDir/StageConfig
      If StageConfig is a directory:
        Set to StageConfig/visioneval.cnf
      If StageConfig is not now an existing file, unset StageConfig
  If StageConfig is set
    Load it into stage$loadedParam_ls
  If StageConfig is not set
    stage$loadedParam_ls <- list()
  StartFrom:
    If not set in stageParam_ls:
      set to definition in stage$loadedParam_ls
    If set, must name an earlier Stage within the containing Model (error otherwise)
  Merge configuration parameters
  Result is stageParameters_ls

This to do when determining if stage is runnable (finalizes its RunParams_ls):
    These parameters should be present in the startingParameters (warn if not)
      Model, BaseYear, Region, State
    These parameters should be present in stageParameters (and will be constructed if not provided explicitly):
      Scenario, Description, InputPath
    These parameters should be present in stageParameters (but will be inherited if not defined here):
      Years
    These parameters may, but need not, be present in stageParameters (and will be defaulted or inherited):
      Seed, ModelScriptFile

Stage Input Configuration Elements explicitly constructed:
  InputPath
    If not provided in stageParameters
      If StagePath is set, set to StagePath
    Add resulting InputPath (if any) to StartFrom/InputPath
  Scenario
    If not provided in stageParameters, set to StageName
  Description
    If not provided in stageParameters, set to StageName

Then do all the remaining "Runnable" stuff
