# Getting Started

How to install VisionEval etc. This document may supplant the Getting
Started that is installed in the VE runtime root.

Introduction to VE directory, package and settings structure, how to
install a standard model and test-run it, links across to tutorials
for different models (their own vignettes)

RSPM tutorial will be here as one of the other vignettes - possibly
more than one (e.g. how to set up zones, how to set up model settings,
how to structure model stages, how to create scenarios).

There is a dual need to document the user API for the framework, and
to use the RSPM model tutorial to elaborate that as a series of steps
and procedures.

Other important vignette topics:

.Rmd walkthrough
Details of model settings
Installing and using the sample models (complete index and explanation)
Items that need to be set up to make a model
Learning about input files
Understanding model outputs
Working with model stages
Running models
Extracting model results
Running Queries
Setting up scenarios
Using the built-in R visualizer
Debugging models
