# Vignettes go here.

Vignettes will be a better form for documenting VEModel than the R help system (which focuses on
individual functions and doesn't do well with R6 classes).

Build the vignettes from a narrative wrapped around the walkthrough.

Some topics for vignettes:
  1. Installing and running a sample model
  2. Looking at model vignettes for instructions on how to localize them
  3. Using the VEModel API
  4. Extracting data from VE model runs

See the 0-GettingStarted.md file (not yet structured to be a vignette)
