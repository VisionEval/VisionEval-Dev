## VisionEval 3.0: The Next Generation

### Walkthrough Instructions

The VisionEval Next Generation (VNG, aka VisionEval 3.0) "walkthrough" is an interactive tutorial
and illustration of what VNG can do. The `walkthrough.R` script is commented and illustrates how to
take advantage the new VNG features and functions.

To use the walkthrough, just start VisionEval and enter this function:

```
walkthrough()
```

It will instruct you to visit several other files in turn from which you can copy commands to see
how VisionEval runs and how to work with it. Much more extensive runnable examples and complete
explanations of the various commands and functions are on the
[VisionEval Documentation site](https://visioneval.org/docs).
