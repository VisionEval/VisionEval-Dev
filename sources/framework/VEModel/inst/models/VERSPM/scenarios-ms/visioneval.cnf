Notes:
  - Some static scenarios implemented as ModelStages
  - Stage directory goes onto the InputPath
  - Dir element of each stage is optional (if directory has name of stage)
  - Better to make explicit in order to document that input files are being changed
  - If stage has no Dir and Dir does not exist, it's no error and stage gets only the StartFrom inputs
  - Notice from the example stages that only inputs that deviate from the StartFrom stage need to be
    included. It is bad practice to include an unmodified file in the scenario ModelStages inputs
  - ScenarioCategories / ScenarioElements are auto-generated - a single Category, with one level mapping
    directly to each ModelStage

StartFrom: "stage-pop-future"       # StartFrom stage for ModelStages (adjust for your model)

ModelStages:
  "Design-1":
     # Inherit year, base year, etc plus the model scripts from stage-pop-future
