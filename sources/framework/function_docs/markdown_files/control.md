### Appendix I: VisionEval Framework Control Functions


### `assignDatastoreFunctions`: Assign datastore interaction functions

#### Description


 `assignDatastoreFunctions` a visioneval framework control function that
 assigns the values of the functions for interacting with the datastore to the
 functions for the declared datastore type.


#### Usage

```r
assignDatastoreFunctions(DstoreType)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```DstoreType```     |     A string identifying the datastore type.

#### Details


 The visioneval framework can work with different types of datastores. For
 example a datastore which stores datasets in an HDF5 file or a datastore
 which stores datasets as RData files in a directory hierarchy. This function
 reads the 'DatastoreType' parameter from the model state file and then
 assigns the common datastore interaction functions the values of the
 functions for the declared datastore type.


#### Value


 None. The function assigns datastore interactions functions to the
 first position of the search path.


#### Calls



### `checkDataConsistency`: Check data consistency with specification

#### Description


 `checkDataConsistency` a visioneval framework control function that
 checks whether data to be written to a dataset is consistent with the dataset
 attributes.


#### Usage

#### Details


 This function compares characteristics of data to be written to a dataset to
 the dataset attributes to determine whether they are consistent.


#### Value


 A list containing two components, Errors and Warnings. If no
 inconsistencies are found, both components will have zero-length character
 vectors. If there are one or more inconsistencies, then these components
 will hold vectors of error and warning messages. Mismatch between UNITS
 will produce a warning message. All other inconsistencies will produce
 error messages.

```ConditionType```     |     A string having a value of either "PROHIBIT" or "UNLIKELY", the two data specifications which use conditions.

#### Details


 This function checks whether any of the values in a data vector match one or
 more conditions. The conditions are specified in a character vector where
 each element is either "NA" (to match for the existence of NA values) or a
 character representation of a valid R comparison expression for comparing
 each element with a specified value (e.g. "< 0", "> 1", "!= 10"). This
 function is used both for checking for the presence of prohibited values and
 for the presence of unlikely values.

 condition that is not met. A zero-length vector is returned if none of the
 conditions are met.


#### Calls



### `checkMatchType`: Check data type

#### Description

 whether the data type of a data vector is consistent with specifications.


#### Usage

```r
checkMatchType(Data_, Type, DataName)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Data_```     |     A data vector.
```Type```     |     A string identifying the specified data type.
```DataName```     |     A string identifying the field name of the data being compared (used for composing message identifying non-compliant fields).

#### Details


 This function checks whether the data type of a data vector is consistent
 with a specified data type. An error message is generated if data can't be
 coerced into the specified data type without the possibility of error or loss
 of information (e.g. if a double is coerced to an integer). A warning message
 is generated if the specified type is 'character' but the input data type is
 'integer', 'double' or 'logical' since these can be coerced correctly, but
 that may not be what is intended (e.g. zone names may be input as numbers).
 Note that some modules may use NA inputs as a flag to identify case when
 result does not need to match a target. In this case, R will read in the type
 of data as logical. In this case, the function sets the data type to be the
 same as the specification for the data type so the function not flag a
 data type error.


#### Value


 A list having 2 components, Errors and Warnings. If no error or
 warning is identified, both components will contain a zero-length character
 string. If either an error or warning is identified, the relevant component
 will contain a character string that identifies the data field and the type
 mismatch.


#### Calls

#### Details


 This function takes a specified module and package, checks whether the
 package has been installed and whether the module is in the package. The
 function returns an error message is the package is not installed or if
 the module is not present in the package. If the module has been called by
 another module the value of the 'CalledBy' argument will be used to identify
 the calling module as well so that the user understands where the call is
 coming from.


#### Value

 inconsistencies are found, both components will have zero-length character
 vectors. If there are one or more inconsistencies, then these components
 will hold vectors of error and warning messages. Mismatch between UNITS
 will produce a warning message. All other inconsistencies will produce
 error messages.


#### Calls



### `checkSpecTypeUnits`: Checks the TYPE and UNITS and associated MULTIPLIER and YEAR attributes of a
 Inp, Get, or Set specification for consistency.

#### Description


 `checkSpecTypeUnits` a visioneval framework control function that checks
 correctness of TYPE, UNITS, MULTIPLIER and YEAR attributes of a specification
 that has been processed with the parseUnitsSpec function.


#### Usage

```r
checkSpecTypeUnits(Spec_ls, SpecGroup, SpecNum)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Spec_ls```     |     a list for a single specification (e.g. a Get specification for a dataset) that has been processed with the parseUnitsSpec function to split the name, multiplier, and year elements of the UNITS specification.
```SpecGroup```     |     a string identifying the group that this specification comes from (e.g. Inp, Get, Set).
```SpecNum```     |     a number identifying which specification in the order of the SpecGroup. This is used to identify the subject specification if an error is identified.

#### Details


 This function checks whether the TYPE and UNITS of a module's specification
 contain errors. The check is done on a module specification in which the
 module's UNITS attribute has been parsed by the parseUnitsSpec function to
 split the name, multiplier, and years parts of the UNITS attribute. The TYPE
 is checked against the types catalogued in the Types function. The units name
 in the UNITS attribute is checked against the units names corresponding to
 each type catalogued in the Types function. The MULTIPLIER is checked to
 determine whether a value is a valid number, NA, or not a number (NaN). A NA
 value means that no multiplier was specified (this is OK) a NaN value means
 that a multiplier that is not a number was specified which is an error. The
 YEAR attribute is checked to determine whether there is a proper
 specification if the specified TYPE is currency. If the TYPE is currency, a
 YEAR must be specified for Get and Set specifications.


#### Value


 A vector containing messages identifying any errors that are found.


#### Calls
checkUnits, Types


### `checkTableExistence`: Check whether table exists in the datastore

#### Description


 `checkTableExistence` a visioneval framework control function that

```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Table```     |     a string identifying the table.
```Group```     |     a string or numeric representation of the group the table is a part of.
```DstoreListing_df```     |     a dataframe which lists the contents of the datastore as contained in the model state file.

#### Details


 This function checks whether a table is present in the datastore.


#### Value


 A logical identifying whether a table is present in the datastore.


#### Calls



### `checkUnits`: Check measurement units for consistency with recognized units for stated type.

#### Description


 `checkUnits` a visioneval framework control function that checks the
 specified UNITS for a dataset for consistency with the recognized units for
 the TYPE specification for the dataset. It also splits compound units into
 elements.


#### Usage

```r
checkUnits(DataType, Units)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```DataType```     |     a string which identifies the data type as specified in the TYPE attribute for a data set.
```Units```     |     a string identifying the measurement units as specified in the UNITS attribute for a data set after processing with the parseUnitsSpec function.

#### Details


 The visioneval code recognizes 4 simple data types (integer, double, logical,
 and character) and 9 complex data types (e.g. distance, time, mass).
 The simple data types can have any units of measure, but the complex data
 types must use units of measure that are declared in the Types() function. In
 addition, there is a compound data type that can have units that are composed
 of the units of two or more complex data types. For example, speed is a
 compound data type composed of distance divided by speed. With this example,
 speed in miles per hour would be represented as MI/HR. This function checks
 the UNITS specification for a dataset for consistency with the recognized
 units for the given data TYPE. To check the units of a compound data type,
 the function splits the units into elements and the operators that separate
 the elements. It identifies the element units, the complex data type for each
 element and the operators that separate the elements.


#### Value


 A list which contains the following elements:
 DataType: a string identifying the data type.
 UnitType: a string identifying whether the units correspond to a 'simple'
 data type, a 'complex' data type, or a 'compound' data type.
 Units: a string identifying the units.
 Elements: a list containing the elements of a compound units. Components of
 this list are:
 Types: the complex type of each element,
 Units: the units of each element,
 Operators: the operators that separate the units.
 Errors: a string containing an error message or character(0) if no error.


#### Calls
Types


### `convertMagnitude`: Convert values between different magnitudes.

#### Description


 `convertMagnitude` a visioneval framework control function that
 converts values between different magnitudes such as between dollars and
 thousands of dollars.


#### Usage

```r
convertMagnitude(Values_, FromMagnitude, ToMagnitude)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Values_```     |     a numeric vector of values to convert from one unit to another.
```FromMagnitude```     |     a number or string identifying the magnitude of the units of the input Values_.
```ToMagnitude```     |     a number or string identifying the magnitude to convert the Values_ to.

#### Details


 The visioneval framework stores all quantities in single units to be
 unambiguous about the data contained in the datastore. For example,  total
 income for a region would be stored in dollars rather than in thousands of
 dollars or millions of dollars. However, often inputs for large quantities
 are expressed in thousands or millions. Also submodels may be estimated using
 values expressed in multiples, or they might produce results that are
 multiples. Where that is the case, the framework enables model users and
 developers to encode the data multiplier in the input file field name or the
 UNITS specification. The framework functions then use that information to
 convert units to and from the single units stored in the datastore. This
 function implements the conversion. The multiplier must be specified in
 scientific notation used in R with the additional constraint that the digit
 term must be 1. For example, a multiplier of 1000 would be represented as
 1e3. The multiplier is separated from the units name by a period (.). For
 example if the units of a dataset to be retrieved from the datastore are
 thousands of miles, the UNITS specification would be written as 'MI.1e3'.


#### Value


 A numeric vector of values corresponding the the input Values_ but
 converted from the magnitude identified in the FromMagnitude argument to the
 magnitude identified in the ToMagnitude argument. If either the FromMagnitude
 or the ToMagnitude arguments is NA, the original Values_ are returned. The
 Converted attribute of the returned values is FALSE. Otherwise the conversion
 is done and the Converted attribute of the returned values is TRUE.


#### Calls



### `convertUnits`: Convert values between units of measure.

#### Description


 `convertUnits` a visioneval framework control function that
 converts values between different units of measure for complex and compound
 data types recognized by the visioneval code.


#### Usage

```r
convertUnits(Values_, DataType, FromUnits, ToUnits = "default")
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Values_```     |     a numeric vector of values to convert from one unit to another.
```DataType```     |     a string identifying the data type.
```FromUnits```     |     a string identifying the units of measure of the Values_.
```ToUnits```     |     a string identifying the units of measure to convert the Values_ to. If the ToUnits are 'default' the Values_ are converted to the default units for the model.

#### Details


 The visioneval code recognizes 4 simple data types (integer, double, logical,
 and character) and 9 complex data types (e.g. distance, time, mass). The
 simple data types can have any units of measure, but the complex data types
 must use units of measure that are declared in the Types() function. In
 addition, there is a compound data type that can have units that are composed
 of the units of two or more complex data types. For example, speed is a
 compound data type composed of distance divided by speed. With this example,
 speed in miles per hour would be represented as MI/HR. This function converts
 a vector of values from one unit of measure to another unit of measure. For
 compound data type it combines multiple unit conversions. The framework
 converts units based on the default units declared in the 'units.csv' model
 definition file and in UNITS specifications declared in modules.


#### Value


 A list containing the converted values and additional information as
 follows:
 Values - a numeric vector containing the converted values.
 FromUnits - a string representation of the units converted from.
 ToUnits - a string representation of the units converted to.
 Errors - a string containing an error message or character(0) if no errors.
 Warnings - a string containing a warning message or character(0) if no
 warning.


#### Calls

### `createGeoIndex`: Create datastore index.

#### Description


 `createIndex` a visioneval framework control function that creates an
 index for reading or writing module data to the datastore.


#### Usage

```r
createGeoIndex(Table, Group, RunBy, Geo, GeoIndex_ls)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Table```     |     A string identifying the name of the table the index is being created for.
```Group```     |     A string identifying the name of the group where the table is located in the datastore.
```RunBy```     |     A string identifying the level of geography the module is being run at (e.g. Azone).

```GeoIndex_ls```     |     a list of geographic indices used to determine the positions to extract from a dataset corresponding to the specified geography.

#### Details


 This function creates indexing functions which return an index to positions
 in datasets that correspond to positions in an index field of a table. For
 example if the index field is 'Azone' in the 'Household' table, this function
 will return a function that when provided the name of a particular Azone,
 will return the positions corresponding to that Azone.


#### Value


 A function that creates a vector of positions corresponding to the
 location of the supplied value in the index field.


#### Calls



### `createGeoIndexList`: Create a list of geographic indices for all tables in a datastore.

#### Description


 `createGeoIndexList` a visioneval framework control function that
 creates a list containing the geographic indices for tables in the operating
 datastore for identified tables.


#### Usage

```r
createGeoIndexList(Specs_ls, RunBy, RunYear)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Specs_ls```     |     A 'Get' or 'Set' specifications list for a module.
```RunBy```     |     The value of the RunBy specification for a module.
```RunYear```     |     A string identifying the model year that is being run.

#### Details


 This function takes a 'Get' or 'Set' specifications list for a module and the
 'RunBy' specification and returns a list which has a component for each table
 identified in the specifications. Each component includes all geographic
 datasets for the table.


#### Value

### `deflateCurrency`: Convert currency values to different years.

#### Description


 `deflateCurrency` a visioneval framework control function that
 converts currency values between different years of measure.


#### Usage

```r
deflateCurrency(Values_, FromYear, ToYear)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Values_```     |     a numeric vector of values to convert from one currency year to another.
```FromYear```     |     a number or string identifying the currency year of the input Values_.
```ToYear```     |     a number or string identifying the currency year to convert the Values_ to.

#### Details


 The visioneval framework stores all currency values in the base year real
 currency (e.g. dollar) values. However, currency inputs may be in different
 nominal year currency. Also modules may be estimated using different nominal
 year currency data. For example, the original vehicle travel model in
 GreenSTEP used 2001 NHTS data while the newer model uses 2009 NHTS data. The
 framework enables model uses to specify the currency year in the field name
 of an input file that contains currency data. Likewise, the currency year can
 be encoded in the UNIT attributes for a modules Get and Set specifications.
 The framework converts dollars to and from specified currency year values and
 base year real dollar values. The model uses a set of deflator values that
 the user inputs for the region to make the adjustments. These values are
 stored in the model state list.


#### Value


 A numeric vector of values corresponding the the input Values_ but
 converted from the currency year identified in the FromYear argument to the
 currency year identified in the ToYear argument. If either the FromYear or
 the ToYear arguments is unaccounted for in the deflator series, the original
 Values_ are returned with a Converted attribute of FALSE. Otherwise the
 conversion is done and the Converted attribute of the returned values is TRUE.


#### Calls
getModelState


### `doProcessInpSpec`: Filters Inp specifications list based on OPTIONAL specification attributes.

#### Description


 `doProcessInpSpec` a visioneval framework control function that filters
 out Inp specifications whose OPTIONAL specification attribute is TRUE but the
 specified input file is not present.


#### Usage

```r
doProcessInpSpec(InpSpecs_ls, InputDir = "inputs")
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```InpSpecs_ls```     |     A standard specifications list for Inp specifications.
```InputDir```     |     The path to the input directory.

#### Details


 An Inp specification component may have an OPTIONAL specification whose value
 is TRUE. If so, and if the specified input file is present, then the input
 specification needs to be processed. This function checks whether the
 OPTIONAL specification is present, whether its value is TRUE, and whether the
 file exists. If all of these are true, then the input specification needs to
 be processed. The input specification also needs to be processed if it is
 not optional. A specification is not optional if the OPTIONAL attribute is
 not present or if it is present and the value is not TRUE. The function
 returns a list of all the Inp specifications that meet these criteria.


#### Value


 A list containing the Inp specification components that meet the
 criteria of either not being optional or being optional and the specified
 input file is present.


#### Calls



### `expandSpec`: Expand a Inp, Get, or Set specification so that is can be used by other
 functions to process inputs and to read from or write to the datastore.

#### Description


 `expandSpec` a visioneval framework control function that takes a Inp,
 Get, or Set specification and processes it to be in a form that can be used
 by other functions which use the specification in processing inputs or
 reading from or writing to the datastore. The parseUnitsSpec function is
 called to parse the UNITS attribute to extract name, multiplier, and year
 values. When the specification has multiple values for the NAME attribute,
 the function creates a specification for each name value.


#### Usage

```r
expandSpec(SpecToExpand_ls, ComponentName)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```SpecToExpand_ls```     |     A standard specifications list for a specification whose NAME attribute has multiple values.
```ComponentName```     |     A string that is the name of the specifications that the specification is a part of (e.g. "Inp", "Get", "Set").

#### Details


 The VisionEval design allows module developers to assign multiple values to
 the NAME attributes of a Inp, Get, or Set specification where the other
 attributes for those named datasets (or fields) are the same. This greatly
 reduces duplication and the potential for error in writing module

```FileName```     |     A string identifying the name of the file that the field names are from. This is used for writing error messages.

#### Details


 The field names of input files can be used to encode more information than
 the name itself. It can also encode the currency year for currency type data
 and also if the values are in multiples (e.g. thousands of dollars). For
 currency type data it is mandatory that the currency year be specified so
 that the data can be converted to base year currency values (e.g. dollars in
 base year dollars). The multiplier is optional, but needless to say, it can
 only be applied to numeric data. The function returns a list with a component
 for each field. Each component identifies the field name, year, multiplier,
 and error status for the result of parsing the field name. If the field name
 was parsed successfully, the error status is character(0). If the field name
 was not successfully parsed, the error status contains an error message,
 identifying the problem.


#### Value


 A named list with one component for each field. Each component is a list
 having 4 named components: Error, Name, Year, Multiplier. The Error
 component has a value of character(0) if there are no errors or a character
 vector of error messages if there are errors. The Name component is a string
 with the name of the field. The Year component is a string with the year
 component if the data type is currency or NA if the data type is not currency
 or if the Year component has an invalid value. The Multiplier is a number if
 the multiplier component is present and is valid. It is NA if there is no
 multiplier component and NaN if the multiplier is invalid. Each component of
 the list is named with the value of the Name component (i.e. the field name
 without the year and multiplier elements.)


#### Calls

### `parseUnitsSpec`: Parse units specification into components and add to specifications list.

#### Description


 `parseUnitsSpec` a visioneval framework control function that parses the
 UNITS attribute of a standard Inp, Get, or Set specification for a dataset to
 identify the units name, multiplier, and year for currency data. Returns a
 modified specifications list whose UNITS value is only the units name, and
 includes a MULTIPLIER attribute and YEAR attribute.


#### Usage

```r
parseUnitsSpec(Spec_ls, ComponentName)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Spec_ls```     |     A standard specifications list for a Inp, Get, or Set item.
```ComponentName```     |     A string that is the name of the specifications the the specification comes from (e.g. "Inp", "Get", "Set).

#### Details


 The UNITS component of a specifications list can encode information in
 addition to the units name. This includes a value units multiplier and in
 the case of currency values the year for the currency measurement. The
 multiplier element can only be expressed in scientific notation where the
 number before the 'e' can only be 1. If the year element for a currency
 specification is missing, it is replaced by the model base year which is
 recorded in the model state file. If this is done, a WARN attribute is added
 to the specifications list notifying the module developer that there is no
 year element and the model base year will be used when the module is called.
 The test module function reads this warning and writes it to the module test
 log. This way the module developer is made aware of the situation so that it
 may be corrected if necessary. The model user is not bothered by the warning.


#### Value


 a list that is a standard specifications list with the addition of
 a MULTIPLIER component and a YEAR component as well as a modification of the
 UNIT component. The MULTIPLIER component can have the value of NA, a number,
 or NaN. The value is NA if the multiplier is missing. It is a number if the
 multiplier is a valid number. The value is NaN if the multiplier is not a
 valid number. The YEAR component is a character string that is a 4-digit
 representation of a year or NA if the component is not a proper year. If the
 year component is missing from the UNITS specification for currency data,
 the model base year is substituted. In that case, a WARN attribute is added
 to the returned specifications list. This is read by the testModule function
 and written to the module test log to notify the module developer. After the
 UNITS component has been parsed and the YEAR and MULTIPLIER components
 extracted, the UNITS component is modified to only be the units name.


#### Calls
getModelState

 specifications in preparation for saving the data in the datastore. Several
 processes are carried out. The existence of each specified input file is
 checked. Any file whose corresponding 'GROUP' specification is 'Year', is
 checked to determine that it has 'Year' and 'Geo' columns. The entries in the
 'Year' and 'Geo' columns are checked to make sure they are complete and there
 are no duplicates. Any file whose 'GROUP' specification is 'Global' or
 'BaseYear' and whose 'TABLE' specification is a geographic specification
 other than 'Region' is checked to determine if it has a 'Geo' column and the
 entries are checked for completeness. The data in each column are checked
 against specifications to determine conformance. The function returns a list
 which contains a list of error messages and a list of the data inputs. The
 function also writes error messages and warnings to the log file.


#### Value

 specifications for the model. It calls the checkGeography function to check
 for errors in the specifications. The checkGeography function reads in the
 file and checks for errors. It returns a list of any errors that are found
 and a data frame containing the geographic specifications. If errors are
 found, the functions writes the errors to a log file and stops model
 execution. If there are no errors, the function adds the geographic in the
 geographic specifications file, the errors are written to the log file and
 execution stops. If no errors are found, the geographic specifications are
 added to the model state file.


#### Value


 The value TRUE is returned if the function is successful at reading
 the file and the specifications are consistent. It stops if there are any
 errors in the specifications. All of the identified errors are written to

sortGeoTable(Data_df, Table, Group)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Data_df```     |     a data frame that contains a 'Geo' field containing the names of the geographic areas to sort by and any number of additional data fields.
```Table```     |     a string for the table that is to be matched against.
```Group```     |     a string for the generic group that the table resides in.

#### Details


 This function sorts the rows of a data frame that the 'Geo' field in the
 data frame matches the corresponding geography names in the specified table
 in the datastore. The function returns the sorted table.


#### Value


 The data frame which has been sorted to match the order of geography
 in the specified table in the datastore.


#### Calls



### `SpecRequirements`: List basic module specifications to check for correctness

#### Description


 `SpecRequirements` a visioneval framework control function that returns
 a list of basic requirements for module specifications to be used for
 checking correctness of specifications.


#### Usage

```r
SpecRequirements()
```


#### Details


 This function returns a list of the basic requirements for module
 specifications. The main components of the list are the components of module
 specifications: RunBy, NewInpTable, NewSetTable, Inp, Get, Set. For each
 item of each module specifications component, the list identifies the
 required data type of the attribute entry and the allowed values for the
 attribute entry.


#### Value


 A list comprised of six named components: RunBy, NewInpTable,
 NewSetTable, Inp, Get, Set. Each main component is a list that has a
 component for each specification item that has values to be checked. For each
 such item there is a list having two components: ValueType and ValuesAllowed.
 The ValueType component identifies the data type that the data entry for the
 item must have (e.g. character, integer). The ValuesAllowed item identifies
 what values the item may have.


#### Calls



### `Types`: Returns a list of returns a list of recognized data types, the units for each
 type, and storage mode of each type.

#### Description


 `Types` a visioneval framework control function that returns a list of
 returns a list of recognized data types, the units for each type, and storage
 mode of each type.


#### Usage

```r
Types()
```


#### Details


 This function stores a listing of the dataset types recognized by the
 visioneval framework, the units recognized for each type, and the storage
 mode used for each type. Types include simple types (e.g. integer, double,
 character, logical) as well as complex types (e.g. distance, time, mass). For
 the complex types, units are specified as well. For example for the distance
 type, allowed units are MI (miles), FT (feet), KM (kilometers), M (meters).
 The listing includes conversion factors between units of each complex type.
 The listing also contains the storage mode (i.e. integer, double, character,
 logical of each type. For simple types, the type and the storage mode are the
 same).


#### Value


 A list containing a component for each recognized type. Each
 component lists the recognized units for the type and the storage mode. There
 are currently 4 simple types and 10 complex type. The simple types are
 integer, double, character and logical. The complex types are currency,
 distance, area, mass, volume, time, speed, vehicle_distance,
 passenger_distance, and payload_distance.


#### Calls



### `writeLog`: Write to log.

#### Description


 `writeLog` a visioneval framework control function that writes a message
 to the run log.


#### Usage

```r
writeLog(Msg = "", Print = FALSE)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```Msg```     |     A character string.
```Print```     |     logical (default: FALSE). If True Msg will be printed in additon to being added to log

#### Details


 This function writes a message in the form of a string to the run log. It
 logs the time as well as the message to the run log.


#### Value


 TRUE if the message is written to the log uccessfully.
 It appends the time and the message text to the run log.


#### Calls
getModelState


### `writeVENameRegistry`: Writes module Inp and Set specifications to the VisionEval name registry.

#### Description


 `writeVENameRegistry` a visioneval framework control function that
 writes module Inp and Set specifications to the VisionEval name registry.


#### Usage

```r
writeVENameRegistry(ModuleName, PackageName, NameRegistryDir = NULL)
```


#### Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```ModuleName```     |     a string identifying the module name.
```PackageName```     |     a string identifying the package name.
```NameRegistryDir```     |     a string identifying the path to the directory where the name registry file is located.

#### Details


 The VisionEval name registry (VENameRegistry.json) keeps track of the
 dataset names created by all registered modules by reading in datasets
 specified in the module Inp specifications or by returning calculated
 datasets as specified in the module Set specifications. This functions adds
 the Inp and Set specifications for a module to the registry. It removes any
 existing entries for the module first.


#### Value


 TRUE if successful. Has a side effect of updating the VisionEval
 name registry.


#### Calls
getModuleSpecs, processModuleSpecs, readVENameRegistry
