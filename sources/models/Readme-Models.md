## Installing models

No models are installed automatically, but can be installed by first installing a model package
(VERSPM, VETravelDemandMM, VERPAT, VEState, VEEERPAT, etc.) then running "VEModel::installModel".

The standard visioneval runtime installs and loads VEModel so it is enough to run "installModel".

TODO: Add installModel documentation here; point people back to GettingStarted
TODO: this document is separate in order to force creation of "models" subdirectory in runtime
