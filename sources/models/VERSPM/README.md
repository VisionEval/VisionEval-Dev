# VERSPM #  
VERSPM is the implementation of the Regional Strategic Planning Model (RSPM) in the VisionEval model system. The model run files are organized into two directories to reflect how the RSPM model has been used in strategic assessments in which hundreds of model runs are carried out to explore the decision space. Typically several land use scenarios are developed and then a number of transportation scenarios are run for each land use scenarios. While the visioneval framework software is built to support that work flow, the initial testing of VERSPM modules runs all land use and transport modules in one sequence. This is done in the **Tests1** directory. Later testing will split apart land use and transport scenarios, splitting them into separate directories.
